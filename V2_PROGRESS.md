# V2 progress

## Phase 0 — COMPLETE (inventory and baseline only)

Base: `b9a83e14b7167a2efb35fa6c4367a692fadb94d1`. Branch: `v2/00-baseline`.

User invoked `docs/tasks/v2/PROMPT.md`. Integration agent assembled this disposable worktree after independent inventory and test-clock review. Original checkout contains unrelated server edits and untracked files, preserved outside this worktree. Task specifications copied unchanged as the authorized implementation reference.

Scope: inventory source and safety boundaries, run isolated baseline checks, record reproducible evidence and synthetic lifecycle fixture. No runtime behavior changes in Phase 0.

Acceptance: source references, suite and reporter/dry-run outcomes, limitations, independent review.

Next: independently verify security-defaults and restart-guard commits, then reconcile on a fresh disposable integration worktree.

Phase 1: IN PROGRESS in isolated worktrees. Phases 2–7 and lease/integration/system-operations extensions: NOT STARTED. T01–T40 and GL01–GL14: NOT RUN as V2 acceptance gates.

## Checkpoint: baseline failures classified

Inventory and evidence recorded in `docs/v2/`. Main suite 839/858 passes; 19 failures share stale October 1 date fixtures. Reporter 25/25 passes. Router dry-run wake agreement 6/10 requires investigation, not a PASS badge.

| Task | Parent | Owner | Branch | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline-inventory | v2-phase-0 | inventory agent | v2/00-baseline | independently reviewed and recorded |
| test-clock | v2-phase-0 | test_clock agent | v2/00-test-clock | independently verified; locally integrated |
| security-defaults | v2-phase-1 | security agent | v2/01-security | independent implementation in progress |
| restart-guard | v2-phase-1 | restart agent | v2/01-restart | implementation in progress |

All branches start at the recorded baseline. At most two implementation workers active. Integration will use a separate disposable worktree; no shared branch or remote mutation authorized. Phase 0 inventory/baseline gate is complete; router discrepancies remain documented work, not a claimed routing PASS. Baseline observed failure is retained in evidence rather than overwritten by repaired results.

Decision: fix clock-dependent tests because the suite must remain useful across dates; do not change production date filtering. Choose safe loopback and normal CLI permission defaults as specified. Unknown leases never imply permission. No arbitrary attempt ceiling is introduced.

## Local integration checkpoint

Reviewed source repair `e9fbf2b78fb5934f1c2d7559096a1d496b6028e6` was cherry-picked as `1bc82f962f82966488a83bc71d5c1eab23faa48a`. Full sanitized regression suite on that exact local SHA: 859 passed, zero failed/skipped. Only documentation is added afterward. Independent verifier did not author the clock patch.

Authority was exclusive ownership of this disposable local worktree only; no shared-resource lease or remote permission is implied. Main has advanced to reported `dccab06` and retains unrelated changes. Eventual integration must resolve the fresh full main SHA, preserve owner changes, and rerun gates on the resulting integration SHA. No shared/main/remote mutation occurred.

Use mycodebox as the product/repository name; preserve existing technical service/package/path identifiers until migrated.
